## The "Aha!" Moment

Data has the power to tell stories, if you know how to listen. I’ve always been a problem-solver at heart, and I realized that data is the ultimate puzzle. I don't just see numbers; I see the opportunity to take a mess of information and find the "aha!" moment that actually changes things.

## What I’m Building

I’m currently deep-diving into the full data lifecycle. I’m not just learning theory; I’m mastering how to clean up chaotic datasets, apply statistical models, and build visual dashboards that make complex problems feel simple and solvable for everyone else.

## The Goal

I love knowing that my work helps someone improve their life, their job, or their company. I’m driven by the win of providing a solution that works. My goal is to keep building projects where technical precision meets real-world impact—helping people make moves based on facts, not just guesses.
